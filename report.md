On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) was notified about a cluster of pneumonia of unknown etiology in the city of Wuhan, China (REF). Chinese authorities later identified a newly emerged coronavirus (2019-nCoV) as the causative agent of the outbreak (REF). As of January 23, 2020, 639 cases have been confirmed in China and several other countries (REF). Understanding the transmission characteristics and the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission of 2019-nCoV is critically important for coordinating current screening and containment strategies, and determining whether the outbreak constitutes a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) (https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/01/who-panel-puts-decision-whether-sound-alarm-rapid-spread-new-virus).

In order to better understand the transmission characteristics of 2019-nCoV, we performed stochastic simulations of early outbreak trajectories that are consistent with the epidemiological findings to date (see appendix). We found that R0 for 2019-nCoV is likely in the range between 1.5 and 2.5, indicating the potential for sustained human-to-human transmission. Overall, transmission characteristics appear to be similar to severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and the 1918 pandemic influenza. The expected level of superspreading cannot be determined with the limited data available to date. Superspreading could be as high as observed for SARS-CoV, or less. Lower levels of superspreading, such as observed for influenza, would result in less explosive but more sustained transmission chains, particularly from cases exported to other countries. These findings underline the importance of heightened screening, surveillance and control measures, particularly at airports and other travel hubs, in order to prevent further international spread of 2019-nCoV.

## Appendix
Stochastic simulations were initialized with 1 to 30 index cases, corresponding to the number of zoonotic animal-to-human transmissions at the wet market in Wuhan. For each infected case, we generated secondary cases according to a negative-binomial offspring distribution with mean $R_0$ and dispersion $k$ (REF). We assumed a gamma-distributed generation time in the range between 7 and 14 days with shape parameter of 2. We further varied the date of the zoonotic transmission events between November 20, 2019, and December 4, 2019. For each individual combination of $R_0$ and $k$, we calculated the proportion of stochastic simulations that reached a total number of infected cases within the interval [427, 4,471] by January 12, 2020, as estimated by Imai et al. (REF).
